# Ecommence Challenge

Frontend ecommerce application created for an interview challenge.
It showcases a mocked book catalog sourced from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using)

For this example, a list of books was retrieved using the following query: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=amigurumi&filter=paid-ebooks&startIndex=0&maxResults=40
and the data was cleaned up using https://jsoneditoronline.org/
